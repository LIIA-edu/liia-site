# About Our Research

Welcome to the Computational Biology Research Lab! Our interdisciplinary team focuses on developing innovative computational methods to understand complex biological systems. We combine machine learning, statistical modeling, and bioinformatics to tackle challenging problems in genomics, proteomics, and systems biology.

## Research Focus Areas

### Computational Genomics
We develop algorithms and statistical methods for analyzing large-scale genomic data, including:

- Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
- Population genomics and evolutionary analysis
- Structural variant detection and analysis
- Multi-omics data integration

### Machine Learning in Biology
Our lab applies cutting-edge machine learning techniques to biological problems:

- Deep learning for protein structure prediction
- Reinforcement learning for drug discovery
- Graph neural networks for biological networks
- Interpretable AI for biomedical applications

### Systems Biology
We study biological systems at multiple scales:

- Gene regulatory network inference
- Metabolic pathway modeling
- Cell signaling dynamics
- Multi-scale modeling of disease progression

## Our Approach

We believe in:

- **Open Science**: All our methods and data are made publicly available
- **Reproducible Research**: Every analysis comes with complete code and documentation
- **Collaborative Innovation**: Working across disciplines to solve complex problems
- **Training Excellence**: Mentoring the next generation of computational biologists

## Recent Achievements

- Developed novel deep learning architecture for protein folding prediction (Nature Methods, 2024)
- Led international consortium for cancer genomics data standardization
- Received NIH R01 grant for multi-omics integration methods ($2.1M, 2023-2028)
- Published 45+ peer-reviewed papers in top-tier journals

## Lab Philosophy

Our lab environment promotes creativity, rigorous science, and work-life balance. We value diversity, inclusion, and mutual respect. Every team member contributes unique perspectives that strengthen our research and create a supportive learning environment.
