# About Our Research

Welcome to LIIA - Laboratório de pesquisa em Imunooncologia e Inteligência Artificial! Our interdisciplinary research laboratory pioneers the application of artificial intelligence to advance cancer immunotherapy and personalized oncology. We develop cutting-edge computational methods that harness AI to understand cancer-immune system interactions, predict treatment responses, and accelerate the discovery of novel immunotherapeutic approaches.

## Research Focus Areas

### Cancer Immunogenomics
We develop AI-driven approaches to understand cancer-immune interactions:

- Tumor neoantigen prediction and immunogenicity assessment
- Immune repertoire analysis and T-cell receptor profiling
- Cancer mutation burden analysis and biomarker discovery
- Multi-omics integration for immunotherapy response prediction

### AI for Immunotherapy
Our lab applies advanced artificial intelligence to enhance cancer treatment:

- Machine learning models for immunotherapy response prediction
- Deep learning for immune cell classification and functional analysis
- Reinforcement learning for personalized treatment optimization
- Computer vision for histopathological immune infiltration analysis

### Computational Drug Discovery
We accelerate the development of novel cancer immunotherapies:

- AI-powered immune checkpoint inhibitor design
- Drug-target interaction prediction for oncology targets
- Combination therapy optimization using machine learning
- Virtual screening for immunomodulatory compounds

## Our Approach

We believe in:

- **Open Science**: All our methods and data are made publicly available
- **Reproducible Research**: Every analysis comes with complete code and documentation
- **Collaborative Innovation**: Working across disciplines to solve complex problems
- **Training Excellence**: Mentoring the next generation of computational biologists

## Recent Achievements

- Developed breakthrough AI model for neoantigen immunogenicity prediction (Nature Methods, 2024)
- Led international consortium for cancer immunotherapy data standardization
- Received NIH R01 grant for AI-driven immunotherapy response prediction ($2.1M, 2023-2028)
- Published 45+ peer-reviewed papers in cancer immunology and AI journals

## Lab Philosophy

Our lab environment promotes innovative AI research, rigorous cancer biology science, and collaborative discovery. We value diversity, inclusion, and mutual respect while fostering creativity in applying artificial intelligence to solve complex immunooncology challenges. Every team member contributes unique perspectives that strengthen our mission to transform cancer treatment.
