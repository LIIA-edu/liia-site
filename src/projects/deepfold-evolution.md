# DeepFold Evolution

## Overview
The DeepFold Evolution project represents our most ambitious initiative in developing computational methods for protein structure prediction. Using state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including transformers and graph neural networks, our goal is to overcome current limitations in predicting complex protein conformations.

## Main Objectives
- Develop new neural architectures that incorporate evolutionary and physicochemical information
- Improve accuracy in predicting loops and disordered regions
- Implement methods for conformational change prediction
- Create automated pipelines for large-scale structural analysis

## Methodology
Our approach combines:
1. **Evolutionary Transformers**: Models that learn evolutionary patterns from multiple alignments
2. **Graph Neural Networks**: To capture spatial interactions between residues
3. **Physics-Informed Neural Networks**: Incorporating physical principles into architectures
4. **Multi-Task Learning**: Simultaneous prediction of structure, function, and dynamics

## Expected Results
- 15-20% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art
- 50% reduction in computational time
- Web server availability for the scientific community
- Publication in high-impact journals (Nature Methods, Science)

## Impact
This project could revolutionize drug discovery, protein engineering, and understanding of diseases related to protein misfolding.
